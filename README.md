# TechBuy
A react site for visitors to find the best deals on tech products. It currently uses Best Buy's API. Contributions from others are welcome :)


To dev, you must get an API Key from Best Buy API and store it in the .env file as REACT_APP_API_KEY


TODO: 
- Pull deals and sales from sites other than bestbuy
- Incorporate dashboard for sellers to list items on the bestbuy marketplace (contacted BestBuy representative regarding this API feature, no firm response yet)
